This project is a Yakuza Information System built using ASP.NET MVC 5 and Entity Framework Code First as part of coursework at City of Glasgow College. It models Yakuza organisations, clans, members, and hierarchy levels, providing full CRUD functionality for each entity.

The application uses a dashboard‑style interface with Bootstrap Icons, custom gold buttons, section banners, and a Yakuza‑inspired colour palette (crimson, charcoal, gold). Navigation is icon‑based, and the Home page presents a modern card layout for quick access to each section.

The system demonstrates key skills in:

      MVC architecture
      
      EF Code First modelling
      
      Database seeding
      
      Scaffolding controllers and views
      
      UI/UX design with Bootstrap
      
      Routing and navigation
      
      Relational data handling

A consistent footer with automatic © year is included across all pages.
The project is intended solely for educational use.
